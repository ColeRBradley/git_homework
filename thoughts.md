I am going to have to get much better at time management and really be-able to set my time up wisely to make the most of my time at Turing.
I am supposed to feel overwhelmed and fail time and time again so that I can get better a fixing my mistakes and learning from them.

I am committed to trying out a calendar system to make better use of my time.
I am committed to finding a balance between school life and home life.

Shoutout goes out to my mother.
